"""Optional preconditioning of the fit parameters.

WHY. The trust-region minimizers solve their subproblem in a *spherical* trust
region, and the Krylov/CG inner solve converges in a number of Hessian-vector
products that grows like sqrt(kappa) of the Hessian. When a block of
parameters is strongly correlated -- typically many unconstrained,
weakly-identified coefficients of a smooth parameterisation, where the basis is
not orthogonal under the data's own weight -- kappa is huge, the inner solve
struggles, and the outer step is rejected. The symptom is outer iterations that
cost minutes and return a bit-identical loss.

WHAT. We reparameterise. With theta the physical parameters, y the internal
ones, theta_ref the point the transform was built at, and a reference Hessian
H0 = L L^T restricted to a selected block (away from a minimum H0 is
generally indefinite and has no Cholesky -- see WHITENING EACH BLOCK below for
the two ways to get an L):

    theta = theta_ref + T y,     T = L^-T   ->   T^T H0 T = I

so the Hessian in y is the identity at theta_ref and the spherical trust region
in y is an H0-aligned ellipsoid in theta. That is exactly preconditioning, but
obtained as a change of variables, which means **the minimizer is untouched**:
scipy's trust-krylov (GLTR/_trlib) accepts no user preconditioner, and it does
not need to.

The chain rule gives what the scipy callbacks must return:

    loss_y(y)      = loss(theta(y))
    grad_y         = T^T grad_theta
    (H_y p)        = T^T H_theta (T p)

T and T^T are applied as dense matvecs against a cached L^-1, which is formed
once at construction. A triangular solve would do the same flops but is
inherently sequential and so cannot use more than one core; the matvec is a
parallel GEMV and measured ~20x faster at m=2112 (0.09 ms vs 1.9 ms). The
triangular solve is kept as a fallback. Forming the inverse is safe here:
against a direct solve it agrees to ~1e-15 even at cond(H)=1e12.

That is worth stating explicitly because the older *offline* in-situ basis had
to row-normalise its L^-1, which looks like a warning against explicit
inverses. It was not one. There the transform reshaped the basis in which the
histmaker precomputed its delta=0.01 finite variations, so a large T moved the
linearisation point far from where those templates were valid -- a modelling
constraint, not a numerical-stability one. Here T is applied to exact vectors
inside the fit, so that failure mode does not arise.

Parameters outside the selected blocks are passed through untouched, so the
transform is a no-op there and a block can be as small as one wants.

WHITENING EACH BLOCK. There are two ways to produce the L above, selected by
--preconditionTransform (see :meth:`_factorise`):

    'ridge' (default)  factorise H + eps*I, raising eps until the Cholesky
                       succeeds. rabbit's original transform.
    'spectral'         factorise |H| = Q |Lambda| Q^T, giving every
                       eigendirection its own scale.

They agree exactly on a positive definite block -- both return the identity,
so nothing is lost on the easy ones -- and differ where H is indefinite. A
single scalar ridge must be at least |lam_min| to restore definiteness, so in
a block whose curvatures span orders of magnitude it swamps every direction
softer than itself and the whitening leaves those near-null: measured on
curvatures (3.3e9, -8.7e6, 1) the O(1) direction came out at 7e-08 and the
block's true condition number went 3.3e+09 -> 1.44e+08, where spectral gives
1. That is the genuine limitation of one scalar number, and the reason
spectral exists.

Spectral takes |Lambda| rather than clipping the spectrum to +eps, which keeps
the SIGN of each direction in the new coordinates. That matters because
trust-krylov exploits negative curvature to escape saddles, and flattening it
to +1 throws that away. It costs an eigendecomposition rather than a Cholesky:
measured 11x at m=200 and 44x at m=2112, i.e. ~1.7 s once per build, against a
fit of tens of minutes.

CHOOSING THE OPTIONS. The guidance for the neighbouring options *inverts* with
the transform, so they are worth reading together rather than one --help
string at a time:

--preconditionBlocks
    Under 'ridge' blocking is a *correctness* tool: one scalar ridge cannot
    serve a block whose curvatures span orders of magnitude, so splitting
    protects the soft directions. Under 'spectral' a larger block is always
    better or equal, since it whitens the cross-terms exactly where splitting
    discards them (measured: one block of 8 gives condition number 1, the same
    matrix split in two gives 4.0). There, blocking only limits the O(m^3)
    cost and 'none' is usually right.

--preconditionBlockThreshold
    Under 'spectral' this works against you: it splits away precisely the
    correlations spectral handles exactly, so "every parameter percolates into
    a single block" is the ideal there rather than the warning it is under
    'ridge'.

--preconditionFrom
    Under 'spectral' there is no reason to pick 'gaussnewton': its PSD-ness
    exists to guarantee the Cholesky succeeds, which spectral does not need,
    and it still cannot represent negative curvature. Prefer 'hessian'.

--preconditionRidge
    Applies to 'ridge' only; spectral derives its floor from the numerical
    rank of the block instead.

WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN. Two different questions get asked about a block, and
conflating them is how a preconditioner comes to look like it worked:

    condition number   kappa of the block itself (:func:`_cond_true`). This is
                       what the minimizer feels -- the Krylov inner solve costs
                       ~sqrt(kappa) Hessian-vector products -- so it is the
                       number a transform has to reduce, and it is reported at
                       BOTH ends of the before/after arrow.
    degeneracy         kappa of the block's CORRELATION matrix
                       (:func:`_cond_corr`), i.e. after normalising to unit
                       diagonal. Scale-free, so it isolates genuine
                       near-linear-dependence from a mismatch of units.

The degeneracy is reported for the block as it ARRIVES only, where the units
are an arbitrary convention and factoring them out is the right thing to do.
It is deliberately not reported for the whitened block, for two reasons:

- the units there are not arbitrary -- they are precisely what the transform
  chose, and flattening them hides the failure mode of a single scalar ridge,
  which swamps every direction softer than |lam_min| and leaves them near-null
  (measured: 1.225 -> 1 by correlation, where the truth is 3.3e9 -> 1.4e8);
- on the spectral path it is not even an approximation, it is an artefact. B
  and |B| share eigenvectors, so with |B| = L L^T the congruence L^-1 B L^-T
  sends Lambda to its own signature: tb is symmetric AND orthogonal, tb^2 = I,
  and true kappa is identically 1 for any block size. But L is a Cholesky
  factor, not the eigenbasis, so diag(tb) is only bounded by [-1, 1] and the
  1/sqrt|diag| normalisation picks up the arbitrary orientation between the
  two. Measured on random indefinite blocks, the correlation number then reads
  1.7 at m=5, 7.7 at m=12, 21 at m=30, 34 at m=60 -- growing with block size,
  i.e. worst exactly where --preconditionBlocks none sends you -- while the
  true value is 1 throughout.

  The identity holds only where nothing was floored: a floored direction is one
  the congruence no longer preserves, so n_floored > 0 legitimately takes true
  kappa away from 1. That is why it is measured per block rather than assumed.

NEVER MAKE IT WORSE. A block is dropped if it cannot be factorised, and also
if whitening it would make its TRUE condition number worse by more than
DEGRADE_TOLERANCE. The second half matters because succeeding badly is not
obviously better than failing: whitening a block whose whole spectrum is
negative needs a ridge of at least |lam_min| ~ max|diag|, which swamps every
direction in it. Measured over 7094 such blocks across four off-diagonal
strengths, the ridge degraded the true condition number in 100% of them, median
10.8x, and improved none. Dropping restores exactly the unpreconditioned
behaviour, so a fit can never come out worse on that block than with
--precondition off.

The guard keys off the true condition number, not the correlation one, which is
blind to the clean case: a diagonal block has the identity as its correlation
matrix both before and after, so diag(-7.5e3, -6.3e4, -2.1e3) reports 1 -> 1
where the truth is 30 -> 320.

It does not act on a block that is already singular to working precision
(SINGULAR_COND). There the true condition number stops being a measurement --
one rank-deficient block reads 5.28e+16 -> 7.32e+16, a 1.39x "degradation"
between two values past 1/eps -- while the correlation number shows the ridge
genuinely helping it, 3.1e+16 -> 1.4e+12. Ridging a rank-deficient block into
shape is what the ridge was for in the first place, so that behaviour is left
alone. It is the mirror image of the all-negative case, and the reason both
metrics are kept rather than one being declared the right one.

One consequence worth being plain about. Expressing the ridge in units of
max|diag| rather than max(diag) means an all-negative block is now reachable at
all -- it used to be rejected before any factorisation was attempted -- but
since ridging such a block essentially never helps, the guard then drops it
again. The net behaviour for those blocks is the same as before; what changed is
that it is now arrived at by measurement, with a logged reason, rather than by a
scale test that was mislabelled (it always said "max|diag|"), and that the same
protection now covers every other block too. The spectral transform is what
actually rescues them: it reaches 1 on the same block.

FINDING THE BLOCKS. The clusters can be read off the reference matrix instead
of being named by hand: threshold the correlation matrix and take connected
components (see :func:`auto_blocks`). On the in-situ efficiency fit that
recovers 239 components where the parameterisation has 240 (step, eta, charge)
blocks, with no knowledge of parameter names, and costs ~4e4 times fewer flops
to factorise than one joint block, since Cholesky is O(m^3).

SEVERAL BLOCKS. The transform is block diagonal: each selected group of
parameters gets its own factorisation and they are applied independently. That
is not only cheaper (m^3 per block instead of (sum m)^3) but often the only
thing that works -- a union of two individually well-behaved groups can be
singular, because the groups are nearly degenerate *with each other*, and one
joint Cholesky then fails where two separate ones succeed. The price is that
correlations between blocks are left alone, so blocks should be chosen to be
the strongly-correlated clusters.

SCOPE. Preconditioning buys little for constrained nuisances: their unit
Gaussian prior contributes the identity, H = I + J^T W J, so kappa is bounded.
The win is for *unconstrained* parameters and POIs, which is the default scope.

Everything here operates on numpy arrays at the scipy boundary; the fitter
keeps holding physical parameters in its tf.Variable, so nothing downstream
(covariance, impacts, pulls) needs to know that preconditioning happened.

    block-diagonal transform wants, and the components are far smaller than the

    ``threshold`` matters: too low and everything percolates into one component,
