"""Helpers for external likelihood terms (linear + quadratic parameter priors).

An "external likelihood term" is an additive contribution to the NLL. For a
Gaussian prior ``N(mu, C)`` on a subset of the fit parameters it is

    -log L_ext = 0.5 (x_sub - mu)^T H (x_sub - mu)  +  lognorm      (H = C^-1)

which this module stores in the expanded form

    -log L_ext = g^T x_sub + 0.5 x_sub^T H x_sub  +  const  +  lognorm

with ``g = -H mu``. The two additive scalars are what make that expansion a
proper Gaussian and are the reason they exist as separate stored quantities:

``const`` = ``0.5 mu^T H mu`` = ``0.5 g^T H^-1 g``
    Part of the *quadratic*, not a normalization: it is what makes the term
    vanish at ``x_sub = mu``. Without it the term reads ``-0.5 mu^T H mu`` at
    the prior mean, so any NLL containing an external term is offset by a
    card-dependent amount and cannot be compared against a card without one.
    Included in both the reduced and the full NLL, mirroring
    ``Fitter._compute_lc``, which writes its own constraint term in centered
    form ``cw * 0.5 * (x - x0)^2`` and therefore never loses this piece.

``lognorm`` = ``0.5 (k log(2 pi) - log det H)``
    The Gaussian normalization, i.e. ``0.5 log det(2 pi C)``. Depends only on
    the prior width, never on ``x``. Included in the *full* NLL only, again
    mirroring ``_compute_lc``, whose ``full_nll`` branch adds
    ``0.9189 + log(sigma)`` per constrained parameter -- exactly this formula
    in one dimension. Only defined for positive-definite ``H``; a term whose
    ``H`` is not positive definite is not a probability density and gets
    ``lognorm = 0`` with a warning.

Neither scalar depends on ``x``, so neither can change a fit result: the
minimum, gradient, Hessian, covariance, EDM and any NLL *difference* taken
within a single fit are all unaffected. They change reported absolute NLL
values (``nllvalreduced``, ``nllvalfull``, and the saturated chi2 built from
``2 * nllvalreduced``), which is precisely where the omission was visible.

Both scalars are derived automatically when the Hessian is dense. For a
sparse Hessian the ``0.5 g^T H^-1 g`` solve and the ``log det`` are not
cheap, so they must be supplied at write time instead -- see
``TensorWriter.add_external_likelihood_term``, whose ``mean=`` argument
computes ``const`` with a single matvec (``0.5 mu^T H mu`` needs no solve
when ``mu`` is known) and is the recommended way to declare a Gaussian
prior. Terms stored without them keep the historical uncorrected behaviour.

Both the linear (``grad``) and quadratic (``hess_dense`` / ``hess_sparse``)
parts are optional; the sparse Hessian is stored as a
``tf.sparse.SparseTensor`` whose indices are in canonical row-major order.

This module centralizes three things that were previously inlined in
``Fitter.__init__``, ``Fitter._compute_external_nll``, and
``FitInputData.__init__``:

* :func:`read_external_terms_from_h5` — load the raw numpy-level
  per-term dicts from an HDF5 group (used by FitInputData)
* :func:`build_tf_external_terms` — turn that list into tf-side per-term
  dicts (resolved parameter indices, tf.constant grads, CSRSparseMatrix
  Hessians, and the two scalars above). Used by the Fitter when it takes
  ownership of the input data.
* :func:`compute_external_nll` — evaluate the scalar NLL contribution
  of a list of tf-side terms at the current ``x``.

def gaussian_scalars(grad, hess, name="<unnamed>"):
    """Derive ``(const, lognorm)`` for a dense Gaussian external term.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grad : ndarray or None
        The linear part ``g``. ``None`` (or all-zero) means the quadratic is
        already centered at the origin and ``const`` is 0.
    hess : ndarray or None
        The dense quadratic part ``H``. ``None`` means there is no quadratic
        and hence neither scalar is defined.
    name : str
        Term name, used in warnings.

    Returns
    -------
    (float, float)
        ``const = 0.5 g^T H^-1 g`` and ``lognorm = 0.5 (k log 2pi - log det H)``.

    Notes
    -----
    ``const`` is computed as ``0.5 g^T H^-1 g`` rather than by forming
    ``mu = -H^-1 g`` first; the two are algebraically identical and this
    avoids a second solve.

    Degenerate cases are handled explicitly rather than raising, because the
    ``g^T x + 0.5 x^T H x`` form is general enough to express things that are
    not priors at all:

    * ``H`` absent or zero -- a pure linear tilt. It has no minimum, so there
      is no constant that centers it and none is added.
    * ``g`` absent or zero -- already centered; ``const`` is 0 exactly.
    * ``H`` singular -- a Gaussian on a subspace, flat elsewhere. The
      pseudo-inverse gives the correct constant for the constrained subspace.
      If ``g`` additionally has a component outside ``range(H)`` the term is
      unbounded below and *no* constant centers it; that is warned about.
    * ``H`` not positive definite -- a saddle rather than a density. The
      centering constant is still well defined, but the normalization is not,
      so ``lognorm`` is 0 with a warning.
