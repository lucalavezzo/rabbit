"""Minimizer callback and the bookkeeping around a stalled fit.

The callback is what scipy calls once per accepted iteration. Beyond logging it
does two things the fitter relies on: it keeps the last parameter vector, so a
minimizer that raises can be rolled back to the end of the last good iteration,
and it detects a *stall* -- no reduction in loss over a run of iterations.

A stall is worth singling out because it is usually recoverable. scipy's
trust-region methods shrink the trust radius 4x on every rejected step with no
lower bound and hold it in a local variable, so a run of rejections leaves the
minimizer taking infinitesimal steps far from any minimum, with the loss frozen
while the gradient is still large. A fresh minimize() call resets the radius, so
the fitter restarts rather than giving up; these helpers carry the state across
those restarts so the whole thing still reports as one continuous fit.

        # own trajectories they keep gaining 0.2-4% per 30 iterations, no
